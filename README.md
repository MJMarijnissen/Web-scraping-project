# Web-scraping-project
My first take on web scraping

**first_request.py** scrapes jokes from https://icanhazdadjoke.com based on user inputs

**blog_scraping.py** scrapes titles, hrefs and dates of blog posts written on https://www.rithmschool.com/blog using BeautifulSoup

**book_scraper.py** scrapes http://books.toscrape.com/ for book titles, prices and ratings. Stores them into a SQL database
